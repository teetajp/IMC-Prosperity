Good day to all traders and teams, and thank you for tuning in to Tropical TV. 

It is only day three, and we’ve already been confronted
with one of the harsh realities of living in our archipelago.

It’s that the weather can change faster than you can say

Sally

sells

SeaShells

by

the

seashore.

Last night, our archipelago got rocked by a tropical storm with a force of 8

on our totally subjective scale of storm intensities.

As a result all islands got moved around.

The bigger islands seem to have drifted towards the center of the archipelago.

So the teams that implemented successful trading strategies

will find their island in that direction.

Islands of teams that have performed suboptimally

have drifted off towards the outskirts.

Oh well... to those on the outer edges I say:

careful you don’t drift off too far. It’s a jungle out there!

Today marks the beginning of a brand new trading round.

This means that the results of the previous round are in.

You can analyze your performance in your island dashboard

and use those insights from it to improve your strategy going forward.

Now, pearls and bananas are great.

But any self-respecting tropical trader should know how to make a profit

with a commodity as basic as coconuts.

Fortunately, coconuts grow abundantly in our archipelago

and are priced at 8,000 SeaShells.

And as we all know

coconuts are actually useful for one thing specifically,

Piña Colada!

So,

these are now also available as a tradable good and priced at 15,000 SeaShells.

And remember:

you can’t have piña colada without coconuts,

but you can have coconuts without piña colada.

These two combined will serve another refreshing trading opportunity

for our beloved inhabitants,

to enjoy responsibly.

Ah! Yes! Another team is dialing in!

Hi,  I’m Jan.

So. Coconuts, piña colada﻿. What is your strategic approach?

A lot of people are gonna hate me for this one but,

you have nothing to prove.

Not sure if it will help you win, but we’ll see, I guess.

This was Tropical TV for today.

Have fun collecting SeaShells,

and hope to see you all tomorrow!
