Good day traders!

And thank you for tuning in to Tropical TV.

Today marks the beginning of the trading season in our beautiful archipelago.

Now, traditionally pearls and bananas are the
most common commodities traded on our market. 

Pearls have been a popular commodity for centuries.

Because, well... who doesn’t like a shimmering pearl?!

Pearls are valued at a steady price of 10,000 SeaShells a piece.

No surprises there.

And then there are our sweet, sweet bananas.

These are also very popular, valued at 5,000 SeaShells a piece.

But its price tends to swing a bit.

So, that could be worth looking into when you work on your trading strategy.

I wonder how you all will handle this first trading opportunity?

Exciting!

Ah! We have a team dialing in to react!

Hello?

Hi, my name is Sophie.

Well tell us, how are you planning to handle this trading opportunity?

Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times,

if only one remembers to turn on the lights.

Ok...

That seems like a solid approach indeed.

Keep up the good work!

And now it’s time to go and implement your own strategy!

Because this was Tropical TV for today.

Have fun collecting SeaShells,

and hope to see you all tomorrow!
