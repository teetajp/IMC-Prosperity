Good day traders! And thank you for tuning in to Tropical TV.

Today some very special ships will arrive in our archipelago.

We are receiving emissaries from our neighboring archipelagos

who are on a special trade mission to trade their goods against our SeaShells.

Sing the Songbird is visiting us from the east archipelago,

bringing wasabi roots to trade...

Devin the Duck, visiting us from the south archipelago.

Is bringing pizza slices to trade...

And Pam the Penguin, visiting us from the north archipelago.

Is bringing snowballs to trade...

Now they are only here for one day,

so make sure that by the end of the day, you have traded with all three of them

and you end up with as many SeaShells on your balance sheet as possible.

Weâ€™re wrapping up today's episode with a quick heads-up.

Today is the last day of round 1.

So all hands on deck

and submit both your program and manual trade before the clock runs out,

to avoid missing the boat.

This was Tropical TV for today.

Have fun collecting SeaShells,

and hope to see you all tomorrow!
