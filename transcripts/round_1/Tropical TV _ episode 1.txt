Good day to all viewers, traders and teams within our fine archipelago.

Welcome to the very first episode of Tropical TV.

Your daily island update, to keep you informed for the next 10 days.

Take a look around and immerse yourself in all the beauty, bounties

and trading opportunities our fine archipelago has to offer.

If you trade well, your island will grow, both in size and appearance.

If you’re performing less, growth stops or even reverses.

But...let’s dream big, no?!

Have you found some SeaShells yet?

It’s our archipelago’s main currency.

To trade with of course, but it’s also how we measure
the trading success of all contending islands.

All trading happens within your dashboard.

This is your lifeline,

where you’ll find anything and everything you’ll need for the coming days.

This is also where you upload your Python program

that will do the trading on your behalf.

You’ll be working on your program most of the time:

coding,

analyzing,

debugging,

reassessing

and recoding.

All to eventually write the perfect trading program.

That will be your main focus.

You will also be challenged by additional
manual trade opportunities every once in a while,

that will allow you to win bonus shells.

Your island’s ranking depends on both your algorithmic and manual trading success.

Oh, and make sure to submit in time!

Every trading round lasts 48 hours,

and both your program and your manual trade should be submitted

before the clock runs out.

As you trade, you will see your island thrive before your very eyes,

growing and evolving into the wonderful island it’s meant to be.

The path to prosperity is a glorious one,

for those that know how to navigate it.

At times it will be challenging. Hard even.

Just know that the Wiki pages are always there to support.

You can also visit our Discord server,

for a chat with fellow traders and IMC professionals

that are ready to guide and assist you during the competition.

That was Tropical TV for today.

Happy trading, and see you all soon!
